    <title>ITIL compliant service support with OTRS::ITSM</title>
    <para>
Just as ITIL, OTRS::ITSM does not claim to be an &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; solution for all tasks and questions arising in IT service management. It is in fact supposed to serve as a flexible, stable and easy to understand information platform.
    </para>
    <para>
Without the thoughtful adaptation of generic ITIL processes to the individual business situation, OTRS::ITSM  will confer no marked improvement core objective of IT service management to IT organization or customer service.</para>
    <para>
Therefore please excuse our raised finger at this point: The use of an ITIL compliant tool such as OTRS::ITSM only makes sense if processes, people and products (IT services) really are ITIL compliant. </para>
    <para>

Successful ITIL implementation projects typically take up to a year and longer. A neatly implemented ITIL compliant ITSM tool can help to save time and money though, as the process support of the tool supports and accelerates the process of rethinking. </para>
    <para>
OTRS::ITSM 1.1 supports the incident and problem management processes, service level management and configuration management database, which usually are designed in the first phase of ITIL implementation. A closer description of use and adaptation of the system can be found in the following sections.
    </para>
    <para>
Implementation of OTRS::ITSM is based on ITIL v2, by the way, which was published in 2000. Aforementioned version remains valid even after the publication of the revised ITIL v3 in summer 2007.</para>
