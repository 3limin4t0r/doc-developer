        <title>Sessions always require cookies</title>
        <para>
            Starting from OTRS 7, sessions always require cookies to be enabled. Therefore, the
            <literal>SessionIDCookie</literal> value was removed from <literal>LayoutObject</literal>,
            Templates and JavaScript. It is no longer necessary to append session variables to URLs or
            HTTP request payloads.
