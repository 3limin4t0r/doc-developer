    <title>Ticket Number Generator Modules</title>
    <para>
        Ticket number generators are used to create distinct identifiers aka TicketNumber for
        new tickets.
        Any method of creating a string of numbers is possible, you should use common sense about
        the length of the resulting string (guideline: 5-10).
        When creating a ticket number, make sure the result is prefixed by the SysConfig-Variable
        SystemID in order to enable the detection of ticket numbers on inbound email responses.
        A ticket number generator module needs the two functions TicketCreateNumber() and
        GetTNByString().
        The method TicketCreateNumber() is called without parameters and returns the new ticket
        number.
        The method GetTNByString() is called with the param String which contains the string to be
        parsed for a ticket number and returns the ticket number if found.

                You will need to create a new ticket number generator if the default modules don't
                provide the ticket number scheme you'd like to use.

        <para>
            You should stick to the code of GetTNByString() as used in existing ticket number
            generators to prevent problems with ticket number parsing.
            Also the routine to detect a loop in TicketCreateNumber() should be kept intact to
            prevent duplicate ticket numbers.
