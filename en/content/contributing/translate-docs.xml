        The OTRS admin manual can be translated via transifex as described in <link linkend="translate">
        the section on translating OTRS</link>. You can join a language team on transifex to improve an existing
        translation or even suggest a new language to translate the admin manual to.

        It is important that the structure of the generated XML stays intact.
        So if the original string is "<code><![CDATA[Edit <filename>Kernel/Config.pm</filename>]]></code>",
        then the German translation has to be "<code><![CDATA[<filename>Kernel/Config.pm</filename> bearbeiten]]></code>",
        keeping the the XML tags intact. Regular &lt; and &gt; signs that are escaped in the source text must also be escaped in the traslations (like "<code><![CDATA[&lt;someone@example.com&gt;]]></code>").
        Scripts and examples usually do not have to be translated (so you can just copy the source text to the translation text field in this case).
