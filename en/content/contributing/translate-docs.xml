        The OTRS admin manual can be translated via Transifex as described in <link linkend="translate">
        the section on translating OTRS</link>. You can join a language team on Transifex to improve an existing
        translation or even suggest a new language to translate the admin manual to.

        It is important that the structure of the generated XML stays intact.
        So if the original string is <literal>Edit &lt;filename&gt;Kernel/Config.pm&lt;/filename&gt;</literal>,
        then the German translation has to be <literal>&lt;filename&gt;Kernel/Config.pm&lt;/filename&gt; bearbeiten</literal>,
        keeping the the XML tags intact. Regular &lt; and &gt; signs that are escaped in the source text must also be escaped in the traslations (like <literal>&amp;lt;someone@example.com&amp;gt;</literal>).
        Scripts and examples usually do not have to be translated (so you can just copy the source text to the translation text field in this case).
