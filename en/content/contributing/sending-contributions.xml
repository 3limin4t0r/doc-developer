    <title>Sending Contributions</title>
    <para>
        The source code of OTRS and additional public modules can be found on <ulink url="http://otrs.github.io">github</ulink>. From there you can get to the listing of all available repositories. It also describes the currently active branches and where contributions should go to (stable vs. development branches).
    </para>

        The easiest way to send in your contributions to the OTRS developer's team is by creating a "pull request"
        in github. Please take a look at the instructions on <ulink url="https://help.github.com">github</ulink>,
        specifically about <ulink url="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">forking a repository and
        sending pull requests</ulink>.
    </para>

        The basic workflow would look like this:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>Register at github, if you have no account yet.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>Fork the repository you want to contribute to, and checkout the branch that the changes should go in.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>Create a new development branch for your fix/feature/contribution, based off the current branch.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>After you finished your changes and committed them, push your branch to github.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>Create a pull request. The OTRS dev team will be notified about this, check your pull request and either merge it or give you some feedback about possible improvements.</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        It might sound complicated, but once you have this workflow set up you'll see that making contributions
        is extremely easy.
